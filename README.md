# Bean-Leaf

**Project Description**
Android application designed to connect coffee shops with merchants. Stores can register their shops and add menus so merchants can view and buy. In addition, stores have to get approved by a master account. The purpose of this application was to understand Android Development process. Lastly, our group was choosen as the best application for this idea.

Created as a group project with James Wolfe, Richard Sun, Steven Zhu, and Mikey Takla during the Fall 2019 semester of CSCI310: Software Engineering at the University of Southern California.

**Technologies Used**
- Android Studio
- Java
- SQLite

**How to execute our test cases:**

After importing our project, all the test files are under two folders: com.example.bean&leaf(AndroidTest) and com.example.bean&leaf(test), the first one is for instrumentation test, and the second one is for Junit test. To execute any of them, you can just open it, right click the file, and click “run <test name>”.

When you try to run the whole file, all the test cases in this file will be run one by one automatically. However, there are some files whose test cases need to be run individually. For detailed information, please refer to the specific section in Black/White box testing.

**Changes since 2.4**
- Fixed Some Testing Code.
- UI updates to make the app more appealing to customers, including but not limited to improved color scheming and additional use of Android Material Design components.
